# Cinema Apps Deployment

The cinema apps deployment is a simple exercise that illustrates how easy is to deploy a microservice architecture to Kubernetes when using Shipa.

The whole suite is composed by 6 NodeJS applications interacting between each other to provide different sets of data that combined together populate a given UI. Each application talks to a different MongoDB database to retrieve the desired information and exposes REST API endpoints to be consumed by the UI. The UI requests data from different endpoints and offer a simple interface to users to see the information generated in these independent apps.

The whole suite is defined by the following applications:

- Movies <- REST API that connects to a MongoDB database and retrieves a list of movies
- Cinema Catalog <- REST API that connects to a MongoDB database and retrieves a list of movie theaters
- Payment <- REST API that connects to a third-party payment service (Stripe) and retrieves results of payment operations
- Notification <- REST API that receives details of a certain transaction and sends them to user by email (fake emailing process)
- Booking <- REST API that connects to Payment and Notifications to register purchase of certain movies.
- UI (future) <- Web application that talks to all previous services and offers a cinema like e-commerce experience to book movies.

Potentially the whole suite can be arranged to achieve the following scenario from a network policies perspective

## Databases - MongoDB Service

Some of the previous applications require a database to persist/read information that will be exposed later on by the API; therefore, having access to a MongoDB service is required.

**Shipa Testing MongoDB**
Host: MONGO-IP
Port: PORT
User: shipa
Pass: shipa2020

Log into the service posted above and create the DBs required for every case

### Movies DB

```sh
mongo -u shipa <MONGO-IP:PORT>

# Verify if databases already exist
show dbs

# Create your "movies" DB
use movies

# Create a user for the DB
db.createUser(
   {
     user: "shipau",
     pwd: "shipapass"
     roles: [
       { role: 'userAdmin', db: 'movies' },
       { role: 'dbAdmin', db: 'movies' },
       { role: 'readWrite', db: 'movies' }
       ]
   }
)

# Exit the current user and log with the recently created one
exit

mongo -u shipau <MONGO-IP:PORT>/movies

# Insert some DB records
db.movies.insertMany([
  {"id" : "1", "title" : "Assasins Creed", "runtime" : 115, "format" : "IMAX", "plot" : "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet", "releaseYear" : 2017, "releaseMonth" : 1, "releaseDay" : 6 , poster: 'assasins-creed.jpg'}
  {"id" : "2", "title" : "Gladiator", "runtime" : 124, "format" : "IMAX", "plot" : "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet", "releaseYear" : 2017, "releaseMonth" : 1, "releaseDay" : 13, poster: 'gladiator.jpg' }
  {"id" : "3", "title" : "xXx: Reactivado", "runtime" : 107, "format" : "IMAX", "plot" : "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet", "releaseYear" : 2017, "releaseMonth" : 1, "releaseDay" : 20, poster: 'reactive.jpg' }
  {"id" : "4", "title" : "Resident Evil: Capitulo Final", "runtime" : 107, "format" : "IMAX", "plot" : "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet", "releaseYear" : 2017, "releaseMonth" : 1, "releaseDay" : 27, poster: 'resident-evil.jpg' }
  {"id" : "5", "title" : "Moana: Un Mar de Aventuras", "runtime" : 114, "format" : "IMAX", "plot" : "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet", "releaseYear" : 2016, "releaseMonth" : 12, "releaseDay" : 2, poster: 'moana.jpg' }
])
```

### Cinema DB

Required DB only if the endpoint to list movie theaters will be tested.

```sh
mongo -u shipa <MONGO-IP:PORT>

# Verify if databases already exist
show dbs

# Create your "cinema" DB
use cinema

# Create a user for the DB
db.createUser(
   {
     user: "shipau",
     pwd: "shipapass",
     roles: [
       { role: 'userAdmin', db: 'cinema' },
       { role: 'dbAdmin', db: 'cinema' },
       { role: 'readWrite', db: 'cinema' }
       ]
   }
)

# Exit the current user and log with the recently created one
exit

mongo -u shipau <MONGO-IP:PORT>/cinema

# Insert some DB records
mongoimport --jsonArray --db cinema --collection docs --file ~/your_path/cinema-catalog-service/src/mock/countries.json
mongoimport --jsonArray --db cinema --collection docs --file ~/your_path/cinema-catalog-service/src/mock/states.json
mongoimport --jsonArray --db cinema --collection docs --file ~/your_path/cinema-catalog-service/src/mock/cities.json
mongoimport --jsonArray --db cinema --collection docs --file ~/your_path/cinema-catalog-service/src/mock/cinemas.json
```

### Booking DB

```sh
mongo -u shipa <MONGO-IP:PORT>

# Verify if databases already exist
show dbs

# Create your "movies" DB
use booking

# Create a user for the DB
db.createUser(
   {
     user: "shipau",
     pwd: "shipapass",
     roles: [
       { role: 'userAdmin', db: 'booking' },
       { role: 'dbAdmin', db: 'booking' },
       { role: 'readWrite', db: 'booking' }
       ]
   }
)

# Exit the current user and log with the recently created one
exit
```

## Applications

To create/deploy all the applications required by this suite, please follow the instructions placed below.

As a summary, all applications will involve:

Once:

- Creating a new framework to host your applications
- Adding the new framework to an existing cluster

Per app:

- Creating a Shipa application as a shell for your app
- Adding some ENV variables to them to connect them to databases/third-party services (Stripe)
- Deploying the application from a Docker hub image

**Note:** Consider that any of the steps can be achieved by using Shipa's Dashboard directly

### Pre-app creation steps

- Create a new shipa framework

```sh
shipa framework add cinema-ui.yaml
shipa framework add cinema-services.yaml
shipa framework add cinema-payment.yaml
```

- Add the new frameworks to the default Shipa cluster or the cluster of your preference

```sh
shipa cluster update shipa-cluster --framework shipa-framework --framework cinema-ui --framework cinema-services --framework cinema-payment
```

### Movies

- Create an application called `movies` 

```sh
shipa app create movies-service --team shipa-admin-team --framework cinema-services

shipa env set -a movies-service DB_SERVER=<MONGO-IP:PORT> DB_USER=shipau DB_PASS=shipapass DB=movies

shipa app deploy -a movies-service -i gcr.io/cosimages-206514/movies-service@sha256:da99b1f332c0f07dfee7c71fc4d6d09cf6a26299594b6d1ae1d82d57968b3c57
```

### Cinema catalog

- Create an application called `cinema` 

```sh
shipa app create cinema-catalog --team shipa-admin-team --framework cinema-services

shipa env set -a cinema DB_SERVER=<MONGO-IP:PORT> DB_USER=shipau DB_PASS=shipapass DB=cinema

shipa app deploy -a cinema-catalog -i gcr.io/cosimages-206514/cinema-catalog-service@sha256:6613440a460e9f1e6e75ec91d8686c1aa11844b3e7c5413e241c807ce9829498
```

### Notifications

- Create an application called `notifications` (

``sh
shipa app create notification-service --team shipa-admin-team --framework cinema-services

shipa app deploy -a notification-service -i gcr.io/cosimages-206514/notification-service@sha256:ca71c0decb3e9194474b9ea121ab0a3432b57beb07f9297fa1233f8f3d6a2118 
```

### Payment

- Create an application called `payment` 

```sh
shipa app create payment-service --team shipa-admin-team --framework cinema-payment

shipa env set -a payment-service DB_SERVER=<MONGO-IP:PORT> DB_USER=shipau DB_PASS=shipapass DB=booking STRIPE_SECRET=your_secret STRIPE_PUBLIC=your_token

shipa app deploy -a payment-service -i gcr.io/cosimages-206514/payment-service@sha256:b1c311b37fb6c74ef862e93288aa869f014e7b77e755a4d71481fe5689204d31
```

### Booking

- Create an application called `booking` 

```sh
shipa app create booking-service --team shipa-admin-team --framework cinema-services

shipa env set -a booking DB_SERVER=<MONGO-IP:PORT> DB_USER=shipau DB_PASS=shipapass DB=booking NOTIFICATION_API_HOST=your_app_endpoint PAYMENT_API_HOST=your_app_endpoint

shipa app deploy -a booking-service -i gcr.io/cosimages-206514/booking-service@sha256:e639bfc7c0926be16f6b59214cc0753d47b168e342bea5e2d34d8f47dbdded27
```

**Optional:**

To give more security to applications handling sensitive data, you can set your own network policies so `payment` does not allow traffic from any other app different than `booking` as its ingress. If that's the case, you can use Shipa's internal DNS to connect `payment` and `booking` together:

- Re-set your ENV variable and use Shipa's internal DNS as the app endpoint

```sh
shipa env set -a booking-service PAYMENT_API_HOST=app-payments.cinema-services.svc:3000
```

### API Gateway

- Create an application called `api-gateway` 

```sh
shipa app create api-gateway --team shipa-admin-team --framework cinema-services

shipa env set -a api-gateway API_BOOKING=you-booking-endpoint API_MOVIES=you-movies-endpoint API_CINEMA=you-cinema-endpoint

shipa app deploy -a api-gateway -i gcr.io/cosimages-206514/api-gateway@sha256:ea7e9efe455f634ab3d9abaae361717c771a9bf4ab8881d005d3cf4b10195e1a
```

### UI

- Create an application called `ui-cinema` (

```sh
shipa app create ui-cinema --team shipa-admin-team --framework cinema-ui

shipa env set -a ui-cinema REACT_APP_API_SERVER=api-gateway-endpoint

shipa app deploy -a ui-cinema -i gcr.io/cosimages-206514/ui-cinemas@sha256:81f61cf1368b65e90a70637f9aa1c25ed741495d391cbbcea807d031e0c2a5e3
```

## Testing the applications

1. From the UI

- Find the public endpoint generated by shipa for `ui-cinema`
- Open the link in the browser
- Evaluate that the API gateway is returning actual data
  - Movies should be loaded
  - Cinemas should be accessible
  - Booking should trigger a request when selecting a movie

2. Directly from REST API endpoints

- Movies -> Run a GET request to `{APP_ENDPOINT}/movies`
- Cinema -> Run a GET request to `{APP_ENDPOINT}/cinemas/588ac3a02d029a6d15d0b5c4`

```json
{
  "cityd": "588ababf2d029a6d15d0b5bf"
}
```

- Payments -> Run a POST request to `{APP_ENDPOINT}/payment/makePurchase`

```json
{
  "paymentOrder": {
    "userName": "daniel",
    "currency": "USD",
    "number": "4111111111111111",
    "cvc": 342,
    "exp_month": 10,
    "exp_year": 2022,
    "amount": 100,
    "description": "Fake purchase"
  }
}
```

- Booking -> Run a POST request to `{APP_ENDPOINT}/booking`

```json
{
  "user": {
    "name": "Daniel",
    "lastName": "Echegaray",
    "email": "test@test.com",
    "creditCard": {
      "number": "4242424242424242",
      "cvc": "123",
      "exp_month": "11",
      "exp_year": "2023"
    },
    "membership": "7777888899990000"
  },
  "booking": {
    "city": "Morelia",
    "cinema": "Plaza Morelia",
    "movie": {
      "title": "Assasins Creed",
      "format": "IMAX"
    },
    "schedule": "Fri Jan 8 2021 23:03:48 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)", // Make sure the date is a FUTURE date
    "cinemaRoom": 7,
    "seats": ["45"],
    "totalAmount": 15
  }
}
```
